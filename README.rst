tattrs
======

``tattrs`` provides support for ``attrs``-style dataclass definitions over
multidimensional arrays. ``tattrs`` is tensor-type agnostic, supporting
``numpy`` ndarrays and ``pytorch`` tensors, but offers rich support for
underlying library semantics. ``tattrs`` combines the development joy of
boilerplate-free definitions, the safety of composable and strongly typed
dataclasses, and the power of a modern numeric libraries. Yippee ki-yay.

Big ups to:

* The teams behind for numpy_ and pytorch_ for providing exceptional core data types.
* The team behind attrs_ for providing a brilliant programming model.
